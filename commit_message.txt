feat: Implement robust frame resizing and splitter behavior

This commit introduces comprehensive frame resizing capabilities:
- Frames can now be resized from both their left and right edges.
- Implemented a splitter-like behavior where dragging the boundary between two frames resizes both adjacent frames simultaneously.
- Removed minimum width constraints during resizing for more flexible control, ensuring widths remain positive.

Bug Fixes:
- Resolved an issue causing "very large movement" during left-edge resizing by correctly calculating width based on original dimensions.
- Fixed `AttributeError: 'QtFrame' object has no attribute 'original_width'` by ensuring proper initialization.
- Addressed a regression where frame resizing stopped working due to incorrect event propagation in `mousePressEvent`.

Refactor:
- Eliminated the use of a global `frames` list, refactoring `FlairApp` to manage frames using an instance variable (`self.frames`) for improved encapsulation and stability.

Documentation:
- Updated `GEMINI.md` with the latest changes and feature descriptions.
